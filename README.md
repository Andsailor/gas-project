# GAS COMPANY LANDING PAGE

This fully-responsive landing page i created using my own Gulp-config. It's very simple to use and gives all necessary functionality for creating web-projects like this. 
You can find my Gulp-config in my repositories, or just use this [LINK](https://github.com/Andsailor/gulp-simple-config)
